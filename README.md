# Task

In this assignment I was tasked with creating code for a password generator. In this code the following critera had to be met:

- A prompt must appear when "Generate Password" is selected
- The user must enter how many characters they would like between 8 and 128 characters
- The user will then select if they would like lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters
- After the final prompt is chosen a password is generated in the "Your Secure Password" box with the critera chosen by the user
